# This file serves to instruct Glossarist which features to enable for which user.

# Currently, users who are not either register or registry managers
# do not need to be listed (only managers do).

# Registry managers are involved with managing infrastructure.
# Register managers are responsible for managing the concept system.

# NOTE: This does not enforce the usage of the app in accordance with user role,
# which must be handled with authentication, Git hooks and/or usage audits.
